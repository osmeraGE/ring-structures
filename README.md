# ring-structures
The classical approach in particle physics is based on the fact that the electron has some parameters like charge, mass, etc. but does not have a structure. The electron is calculated as point particle having magnetic properties. Theory VFRT (Vortex Fractal Ring Theory) uses the electron, proton, and neutron as the particle with a toroidal (ring) shape, which is formed by fractal substructures connected to each other by vortex electromagnetic fields. The atomic nucleus can be built from the ring protons and neutrons. Combining knowledge of atomic nucleus structures and evolutionary optimization makes it possible to create programs for designing new nanostructure models. The first testing proposal for the nanostructure prediction program was limited to carbon structures. The aim was to verify whether the proposed program is capable of generating known carbon nanostructures, such as graphene. The following versions of the program will no longer have this limitation.
